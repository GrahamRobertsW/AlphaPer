\Huge{As mentioned the Alpha Persei cluster is a group of nearby young stars.  This cluster is relatively well spread out compared to other star clusters.  Previous Surveys identified many members, however not enough to get a terribly accurate age estimate.  Our method for performing this age estimate is by fitting a model isochrone the the color and magnitude of the cluster.  The current Membership survey of $\alpha$ per unfortunately lacking in stars who's color and magnitude fall around the turnoff on the color magnitude diagram. This is unfortunately the point at which these model diverge the most with age.  For that reason our study has thus far focused on a membership survey.}
